# London Bicycle Load Balancing Problem

The SQL query in bicycle_station_analysis.sql produces a view for the top 5 bicycle rental stations in London broken down by month and year. The rank is determined by the stations renting out the most bicycles for a specific year and month.

Below is a sample output of what can be expected when running the query in Google Big Query. The number 1 station for January 2023 is Waterloo Station 3, Waterloo with 1193 bicyle rentals.
